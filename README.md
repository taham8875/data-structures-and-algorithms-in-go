# Data Structures and Algorithms in Go

My playground while reading data structure and algorithms in go book by Hemant Jain, I either practice writing sample codes or write md files to summarize what I am learning.

It makes no sense to read my notes or code if you can get access to the book and read it, I am just doing this for my own learning and practice.
