# Approach to Solve Algorithmic Design Problems

Five steps to solve algorithmic design problems:

1. Constraints
2. Ideas generation
3. Complexity analysis
4. Coding
5. Testing

# Constraints

You should never try to solve a problem that is not completely defined. You should always ask questions to clarify the problem.

Interview questions are not like exam papers where all inputs are completely defined. You interviewers will expect you to ask questions.

For example, when the problem statement says that write an algorithm to sort a list, you should ask questions like:

- What is the data type of the list?
- What is the size of the list? The algorithm differs if the input size is 100 or 1 billion.

# Idea Generation

Once you have understood the problem, you should start thinking about the solution.

- Try to simplify the problem
- Try a few examples
- Think about the suitable data structure
- Think about similar problems you have solved before

# Complexity Analysis

Solving a problem is not just getting the correct answer, it is also about getting the correct answer in the most efficient way (or at least in reasonable time).

# Coding

At this point, you should have a clear idea of the solution. You should start coding.

In most cases, you will be coding in an IDE like Visual Studio Code. But from time to time you need to practice whiteboard coding. Think carefully because there are no undo or auto-complete features on a whiteboard. Try to write your code in modular way. If there is a helper function, write it first. If it is so simple like a swap function, you can tell your interviewer that you are going ignore it for now, everyone knows how to write a swap function.

# Testing

Finishing coding does not mean you are done. You should test your code with several small test cases. It shows that you are aware of the importance in testing your code.

There are several kinds of tests you can do:

- Normal test cases
- Edge cases
- Heavy loading
